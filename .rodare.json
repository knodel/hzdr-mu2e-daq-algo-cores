    "description": "This project contains the source code for the evaluation of an automated process which converts algorithms written in C/C++ to Data Acquisition (DAQ) hardware cores on Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) using Continuous Integration (CI). The cores are building blocks of the DAQ for the Stopping-Target-Monitor of the MU2E experiment currently in construction at FERMILAB (USA). The MU2E experiment will search for Charged Lepton Flavor Violation (CLFV) looking for the direct decay of a muon into an electron."
